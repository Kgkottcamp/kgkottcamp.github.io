										From the interviews I conducted, there were several different insights I gathered. All of the interviewees

										Of all of these interviews however, there was one significant issue that everyone had in common, which

										external calendar app. The solution going forward became to build an in app calendar system that allows

										Through user research, I discovered a clear problem with the Zoom app's lack of 
										scheduling and organization tools for students. By adding a calendar feature to 
										the app, I was able to provide a solution that made it easier for students to 
										manage their schedules and attend the right classes. The new feature was effective 
										in reducing frustration and confusion among students, leading to a better online 
										learning experience. The success of the redesign highlights the importance of 
										user research and testing in creating a user-centered design that addresses user 
										pain points and provides a better user experience.

										After making several lofi prototypes and iteratively having them user tested by the same people 
										I had interviewed, I had refined the design of the calendar to be as intuitive to use as possible. 
										I also further streamlined the homepage which was still causing some confusion, specifically how 
										it showed an option to screen share even if the user was not in a call. Lastly I made some minor 
										aesthetic changes to the navigation bar to better emphasize its pages, which now included the calendar, 
										as well as change the color of the “Enter Call” button to orange, which I used app-wide as the 
										signature color for paths that lead directly to a call.

										Through user research, I discovered a clear problem with the Zoom app's lack of 
										scheduling and organization tools for students. By adding a calendar feature to 
										the app, I was able to provide a solution that made it easier for students to 
										manage their schedules and attend the right classes. The new feature was effective 
										in reducing frustration and confusion among students, leading to a better online 
										learning experience. The success of the redesign highlights the importance of 
										user research and testing in creating a user-centered design that addresses user 
										pain points and provides a better user experience.
