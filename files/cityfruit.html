									Based on my research, the visitor is most likely to first discover CityFruit’s website from online articles, social media, or word of mouth. 
									Most users will reach it via link rather than web search, thus will likely already have a basic understanding of what City Fruit actually does.
									<br><br>
									When they first enter the website, the visitor will be greeted with a reiteration of the NGO’s tree harvest program with a direct 
									link to sign up. Scrolling down the home page will have links to specific information about the program for user’s who wish to 
									learn more, as well as statistics about City Fruit’s success with the program to demonstrate its effectiveness.
									<br><br>
									Users who wish to learn more about City Fruit itself can visit the About, Solutions, and Blog pages where they will be convinced 
									that it is a real organization with history and it’s projects are actively ongoing, and also shows that they can be trusted to 
									come to the user’s private property.
									<br><br>
									After being convinced that joining the tree harvesting pro-gram is a good thing that can help people, and that City Fruit is an 
									organization that can be trusted, the user will simply click the GIVE A TREE button on the navbar. They will be brought to the 
									sign-up page to fill out an application to donate their fruit tree.
									<br><br>
									After clicking send, they will be sent to a confirmation page that shows the application was successfully sent and provides 
									instruction to check their email for a response from City Fruit.

									I also created two different versions of each page, one with a translucent navbar and one with a solid with drop

									It was critical to the project success to conduct thorough research before beginning

									<br><br>
									It was also a challenge balancing aesthetics and functionality, both to satisfy the 
									organization and the potential visitors/donors. To successfully get visitors to sign 
									up for the program, the website had to be visually appealing, user-friendly and provide

									The site map has been simplified down to prioritize core, relevant, information first while additional information can be found within the footer.
									<br><br>
									The GIVE A TREE page can be accessed from any page via the navbar which is highlighted to encourage users to check it out as that is the main service of the organization.
									<br><br>
									All other information that is not relevant enough, or that is better off accessed through direct reach out has been removed in order to clear clutter from the site.

									After conducting user testing and receiving feedback, I found that people weren’t quite sure what Join/Sign up meant, 
									they thought it making an account on the site rather than signing up for the service. To fix this I renamed it, 
									GIVE A TREE to make it clearer what the application was for.
									<br><br>
									Additionally when adding in the actual text copy, I realized there was too much text on the About page to fit the 
									lofi design so I had to change the layout.

									However, upon review, I realized that this caused to much scrolling. Instead, I turned them into a carousel 
									which made the overall page scrolling much shorter. I would go on to make further changes after more user testing.

									it semitransparent on one side to allow for most of the screen to still be visible while still having background for the nav menu.
									<br><br>
									I also created two different versions of each page, one with a translucent navbar and one with a solid with drop
									shadow that would automatically swap in once the user scrolls further down the page to make sure it doesn’t blend in with
									other assets.

									It was critical to the project success to conduct thorough research before beginning 
									the design process. Understanding the goals and target audience of the website were 
									crucial for making design decisions that effectively commun-icated CityFruit’s mission.
									<br><br>
									It was also a challenge balancing aesthetics and functionality, both to satisfy the 
									organization and the potential visitors/donors. To successfully get visitors to sign 
									up for the program, the website had to be visually appealing, user-friendly and provide 
									easy access to important information moved in order to clear clutter from a site.
