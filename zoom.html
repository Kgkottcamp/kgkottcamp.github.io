      <span class="v1158_9">Zoom Conferenceing Redesign</span
      ><span class="v1158_10"
        >For this project in DSGN 310, we were tasked to first pick a product
        category out of various different types of services and then decide on a
        specific product within that category to focus on. I chose the Zoom
        conferencing app as it was a service I personally used a lot during the
        covid-19 pandemic.</span
      ><span class="v1158_11">Problem</span
      ><span class="v1164_97"
        >Through user research, I discovered that students using Zoom for remote
        classes would often show up late to meetings. This was because the main
        way they’d enter the call was by franticly pulling up the meeting link
        on a separate platform, such as Canvas. It is already possible to set up
        recurring meetings on Zoom, however none of the students I interviewed
        were aware of this feature.</span
      ><span class="v1158_12">Solution</span
      ><span class="v1164_75"
        >Based on my user research and feedback, I built a new in-app calendar
        system with intuitive meeting setup and management controls, and added
        it to the main nav bar to more prominently showcase its presence. This
        helped casual users quickly notice and understand the feature so they
        would no longer need to take the more complicated and redundant, link
        based, path to joining a meeting every time.</span
      ><span class="v1158_13">Insights</span
      ><span class="v1164_93"
        >From the interviews I conducted, there were several different insights
        I gathered. All of the interviewees had some negative perception of
        Zoom, some of them had issue with the social experience compared with in
        person meetings, others had more technical problems such as the audio
        systems being unintuitive. <br><br>
        
        Of all of these interviews however, there was
        one significant issue that everyone had in common, which was the stress
        they felt when trying to join a class meeting. Each of their professors
        had a different zoom link and it was always posted in different places,
        forcing the user to memorize where to look for the link. Because this
        was a common overlapping issue for each of my interviewees, it became
        the main problem that I choose to tackle.<br><br>
        
        Upon further analyzing the
        Zoom desktop app, I found that it already had a solution to this issue,
        that being the Outlook link feature. The problem with this however was
        that neither me, nor any of my interviewees had any idea that this
        feature existed as it was buried under menus and forced you to link Zoom
        with an external calendar app. The solution going forward became to
        build an in app calendar system that allows users to set up recurring
        meetings, and to elevate it’s presence to be more noticeable to Zoom’s
        users. </span
      ><span class="v1158_14"
        >I began the design process by creating wireframes of the calendar page.
        This was inspired by the Outlook calendar as it is the tool the most of
        my interviewees were already comfortable with using.</span
      ><span class="v1164_94"
        >The section on the right is the calendar view itself, giving the user
        an overview of all their meetings throughout the month and add new
        meetings quickly by clicking on any day.</span
      ><span class="v1164_95"
        >On the left side is a window that lists upcoming meetings, this is a
        more focused view that doesn’t require users to try to figure out where
        they currently are on tthe calendar.</span
      ><span class="v1158_15">Prototype</span
      ><span class="v1164_96"
        >After making several lofi prototypes and iteratively having them user
        tested by the same people I had interviewed, I had refined the design of
        the calendar to be as intuitive to use as possible. I also further
        streamlined the homepage which was still causing some confusion,
        specifically how it showed an option to screen share even if the user
        was not in a call. Lastly I made some minor aesthetic changes to the
        navigation bar to better emphasize its pages, which now included the
        calendar, as well as change the color of the “Enter Call” button to
        orange, which I used app-wide as the signature color for paths that lead
        directly to a call. </span
      ><span class="v1158_16"
        >In order to make the calendar more visible, I also updated the home
        page slightly by replacing the “schedule meeting” button with the
        calendar. Although this added an extra step to scheduling a meeting, the
        user research pointed to calendar being the more important feature, also
        because the scheduling feature is now simplified specifically by the
        calendar functionality. Users can now just click a date and set up a
        meeting instead of having to manually type it in a pop up window. </span
      ><span class="v1158_17"
        >Through user research, I discovered a clear problem with the Zoom app's
        lack of scheduling and organization tools for students. By adding a
        calendar feature to the app, I was able to provide a solution that made
        it easier for students to manage their schedules and attend the right
        classes. The new feature was effective in reducing frustration and
        confusion among students, leading to a better online learning
        experience. The success of the redesign highlights the importance of
        user research and testing in creating a user-centered design that
        addresses user pain points and provides a better user experience.</span

        >Before having any idea of what Zoom’s problems or solutions could be, I
        began by researching various statistics about Zoom, its user base, its
        history, and any other helpful information I could find. This
        information didn’t tell me much about what people thought of Zoom, but
        what it did show was some important quantitative data on the types of
        people using it. Next I was able to narrow my focus down to certain
        groups which helped me later on develop user personas.</span
      ><span class="v1158_37">Personas</span
      ><span class="v1164_84"
        >Since I found out from my research that a large segment of Zoom’s user
        base were students, a group I personally identify as, this is the
        specific group I decided to focus in on when searching for pain points.
        Here is one of a few user personas I created. At first they remained
        fairly basic without goals or pain points, however they provided an even
        clearer picture of what kinds of people I would go onto interview. After
        conducting several interviews I took these insights I had gathered and
        fleshed out the personas further. </span
