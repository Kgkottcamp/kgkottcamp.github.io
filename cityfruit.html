      <span class="v1166_105">City Fruit Website Redesign</span
      ><span class="v1166_106"
        >For my college UX design project, I redesigned the website for
        Cityfruit.org, a non-profit organization promoting urban fruit
        cultivation. The goal was to improve the website's functionality,
        aesthetics, and user experience. Through research, prototyping, and
        testing, I created a design that met user needs while aligning with the
        organization's mission and values.</span
      ><span class="v1166_245">Figuring it Out: What is City Fruit?</span
      ><span class="v1166_246"
        >I began by researching everything about the NGO, what it does, its
        history, how they communicate with their audience, etc, from their
        website and social media. From the research, I figured out the specific
        purpose of their website, beyond simply informing people about them. </span
      ><span class="v1166_107">Background.</span
      ><span class="v1166_108">The Plan.</span
      ><span class="v1166_109">Design Process.</span
      ><span class="v1166_112">THE OBJECTIVE</span
      ><span class="v1166_252"
        >To redesign the City Fruit website to better accomplish its main
        purpose, teach users about the org and guide them to sign up for “GIVE A
        TREE”.</span
      ><span class="v1166_113">AUDIENCE</span
      ><span class="v1166_253"
        >City Fruit’s target audience includes urban residents of Seattle and
        surrounding areas who own property with fruit trees on them, most likely
        middle aged, financially able own a house, and who are charitable enough<br>
        to want to sign up for such a program <br>to help those in need. </span
      ><span class="v1166_114">KEY MESSAGE</span
      ><span class="v1166_255"
        >City Fruit is a community-based non-profit organizations dedicated to
        promoting healthy and sustainable urban ecosystems by harvesting and
        caring for fruit trees in the Seattle metropolitan area.</span
      ><span class="v1166_115">Site Map</span
      ><span class="v1166_260"
        >The site map has been simplified down to prioritize core, relevant,
        information first while additional information can be found within the
        footer. <br> <br>The GIVE A TREE page can be accessed from any page via the
        navbar which is highlighted to encourage users to check it out as that
        is the main service of the organization.<br> <br> All other information that is
        not relevant enough, or that is better off accessed through direct reach
        out has been removed in order to clear clutter from the site.</span
      ><span class="v1166_118">Translating <br> to Mobile</span
      ><span class="v1166_264"
        >Converting to mobile at first seemed fairly straight forward, I had the
        same layout as desktop mostly except further scrolling, with three info
        cards on the main menu in a vertical position. However, upon review, I
        realized that this caused to much scrolling. Instead, I turned them into
        a carousel which made the overall page scrolling much shorter. I would
        go on to make further changes after more user testing.</span
      ><span class="v1166_119">Mobile Hifi</span
      ><span class="v1166_265"
        >I received additional feedback from user testing on the Hifi mobile
        prototype. The testers seemed to have issue with the nav menu taking up
        too much space when in the dropdown state. To fix this I made it
        semitransparent on one side to allow for most of the screen to still be
        visible while still having background for the<br>nav menu. </span
      ><span class="v1166_267"
        ><br>I also created two different versions of each page, one with a
        translucent navbar and one with a solid with drop shadow that would
        automatically swap in once the user scrolls further down the page to
        make sure it doesn’t blend in with <br>other assets.</span
      >
      <div class="v1166_120"></div>
      <span class="v1166_121"
        >The core mission of City Fruit is to harvest fruit from peoples’ unused
        fruit trees in urban areas to give to foodbanks. </span
      ><span class="v1166_247"
        >The core purpose of the website is to convince and guide property
        owners to sign up to have their trees harvested. </span
      ><span class="v1166_248"
        >I conducted a usability test on the current website to see how well it
        achieves the purpose is and identified the pain points that interrupt
        the achievement of the goal.</span
      ><span class="v1166_249">
        The key findings of the usability test are their navbar is way too
        crowded, making it difficult to find specific information.</span
      ><span class="v1166_250"
        >The aesthetic, “ugliness” of the website subtracts from organization’s
        reputability/trust.</span
      ><span class="v1166_251">
        The ability to sign up for tree harvesting is buried behind multiple
        menus and carousel, reducing the likelihood of signing up.</span
      ><span class="v1166_122">KEY ELEMENTS</span
      ><span class="v1166_256"
        >Clear and concise information about the organization and its mission. <br><br>
        Information about how to get involved (e.g. volunteering and donating).<br><br>
        Information about City Fruit’s programs and initiatives. <br><br> Resources for
        urban fruit tree care and harvesting.<br><br> Easy-to-use navigations.<br><br> Engaging
        and visually appealing design. </span

        >After conducting user testing and receiving feedback, I found that
        people weren’t quite sure what Join/Sign up meant, they thought it
        making an account on the site rather than signing up for the service. To
        fix this I renamed it, GIVE A TREE to make it clearer what the
        application was for. </span

        >Based on my research, the visitor is most likely to first discover
        CityFruit’s website from online articles, social media, or word of
        mouth. Most users will reach it via link rather than web search, thus
        will likely already have a basic understanding of what City Fruit
        actually does. <br> <br> When they first enter the website, the visitor will be
        greeted with a reiteration of the NGO’s tree harvest program with a
        direct link to sign up. Scrolling down the home page will have links to
        specific information about the program for user’s who wish to learn
        more, as well as statistics about City Fruit’s success with the program
        to demonstrate its effectiveness.<br> <br> Users who wish to learn more about
        City Fruit itself can visit the About, Solutions, and Blog pages where
        they will be convinced that it is a real organization with history and
        it’s projects are actively ongoing, and also shows that they can be
        trusted to come to the user’s private property. <br> <br>After being convinced
        that joining the tree harvesting pro-gram is a good thing that can help
        people, and that City Fruit is an organization that can be trusted, the
        user will simply click the GIVE A TREE button on the navbar. They will
        be brought to the sign-up page to fill out an application to donate
        their fruit tree. <br> <br>After clicking send, they will be sent to a
        confirmation page that shows the application was successfully sent and
        provides instruction to check their email for <br> a response from City Fruit.

        >It was critical to the project success to conduct thorough research
        before beginning the design process. Understanding the goals and target
        audience of the website were crucial for making design decisions that
        effectively commun-icated CityFruit’s mission.</span
      ><span class="v1166_282"
        >It was also a challenge balancing aesthetics and functionality, both to
        satisfy the organization and the potential visitors/donors. To
        successfully get visitors to sign up for the program, the website had to
        be visually appealing, user-friendly and provide easy access to
        important information.moved in order to clear clutter from a site.</span
