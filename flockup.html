										By spending time to think through what the Flock Up app could be, who would be the target audience and what benefits would

										the unintended consequence of expanding the scope of the project meant it was becoming too much for us to be able to complete 
										within our limited time. From a team dynamic perspective, neither the designers or the developers had a keen sense for how 
										long each part of the project would take, from design to develop and deploy.

										This resulted in holding a group meeting to decide which features were truly essential to the vision, versus which ones were 
										nice additions, but not essential. This exercise in scope management was difficult but taught us a lot about balancing scope and 
										deadlines.
										<br><br>
										For example, we were hoping to add a calendar system to help teams plan their project work. It would have definitely added to 
										the value of the app, but it was not essential to key functionality and finding and selecting teams for the project. In the end, 
										we placed a cap on the number of features we could add based on what was already planned out.

										One of the victims of our timeline was our ability to conduct full user testing on the prototype. As a quicker alternative,

										path even given the limited time and resources and to meet our deadline. Here are some examples of solutions that came

										The Flock Up app project taught me a lot about working with complex requirements, cross- functional teams and most importantly, 
										large scale design systems. Previously, I was used to focusing on a specific feature or single user flow, but in this case, 
										I was forced to simultaneously visualize many different parts that make up the entire product, process and design.
										<br><br>
										As the sole designer on the team, this became even more critically important as it became my role to manage the majority of 
										the end-to-end process, including both design and development, as well as effectively managing the entire team in order to 
										achieve our desired vision.
										<br><br>
										I’ve been exposed to a wide set of issues that comes with large scale projects including scope creep. I’ve had to learn to 
										communicate much better with non-designers, understand their abilities, limitations and unique perspectives.
										<br><br>
										My biggest takeaway from the experience was that these are all things I enjoy on top of simply designing. Perhaps the is a 
										design oriented project management role in my future.

										Having reached a consensus about the vision and purpose of the Flock Up app, I laid out the two primary use cases which

										particular project. Whereas in the second use case, the user wanted to join someone else’s team and project. While both

										By spending time to think through what the Flock Up app could be, who would be the target audience and what benefits would 
										accrue from using the app, we were able to produce a well-defined idea that we believed could deliver real value. However, 
										the unintended consequence of expanding the scope of the project meant it was becoming too much for us to be able to complete 
										within our limited time. From a team dynamic perspective, neither the designers or the developers had a keen sense for how 
										long each part of the project would take, from design to develop and deploy.

										This resulted in holding a group meeting to decide which features were truly essential to the vision, versus which ones were 
										nice additions, but not essential. This exercise in scope management was difficult but taught us a lot about balancing scope and 
										deadlines.
										<br><br>
										For example, we were hoping to add a calendar system to help teams plan their project work. It would have definitely added to 
										the value of the app, but it was not essential to key functionality and finding and selecting teams for the project. In the end, 
										we placed a cap on the number of features we could add based on what was already planned out.

										The Flock Up app project taught me a lot about working with complex requirements, cross- functional teams and most importantly, 
										large scale design systems. Previously, I was used to focusing on a specific feature or single user flow, but in this case, 
										I was forced to simultaneously visualize many different parts that make up the entire product, process and design.
										<br><br>
										As the sole designer on the team, this became even more critically important as it became my role to manage the majority of 
										the end-to-end process, including both design and development, as well as effectively managing the entire team in order to 
										achieve our desired vision.
										<br><br>
										I’ve been exposed to a wide set of issues that comes with large scale projects including scope creep. I’ve had to learn to 
										communicate much better with non-designers, understand their abilities, limitations and unique perspectives.
										<br><br>
										My biggest takeaway from the experience was that these are all things I enjoy on top of simply designing. Perhaps the is a 
										design oriented project management role in my future.
