      <span class="v1157_10">Flock Up Team Matchmaking</span
      ><span class="v1157_11"
        >What started as a group project where design and computer science
        students were intended to work together to produce a digital
        application, which would exhibit the principles of Human Computer
        Interaction, turned into an opportunity to demonstrate how young
        professionals could self-select and come together as effective teams. As
        the sole designer on our team, it was up to me to guide the entire
        design and development process in a user-centered manner.</span
      ><span class="v1157_12"
        >The product “Flock Up” is a digital application that provides the means
        for young professionals to match themselves with the right team that
        will work together and deliver the best results for a particular
        project. Users can advertise for prospective teammates with the right
        skill sets and temperament to join their team. Or they can request to
        join someone else’s team that they find interesting by directly
        contacting the team creator.</span
      ><span class="v1157_13"
        >Additionally, Flock Up provides a Discord/Slack style group chat room
        to allow teams to self-organize and communicate effectively without the
        need to leave the platform. Additionally, each team member is able to
        leave reviews on the profiles of other teammates that they’ve worked
        with, rate their abilities and performance and indicate their level of
        mutual satisfaction.</span
      ><span class="v1157_14">What is Flock Up</span
      ><span class="v1157_15"
        >The idea of making it easier for teams to self-organize and find the
        right teammates grew out of our own team members’ experience with the
        negative outcomes that resulted from poor teams, who were not fully
        engaged and who did not do a good job of communication. Everyone
        believed that there had to be a better way to match people up with
        like-minded highly committed individuals, dedicated to producing the
        best outcomes. </span
      ><span class="v1157_16"
        ><br>From this common understanding of the problem, we conceived of an app
        that could give more insight and considerations when assembling the
        right mix of people to form the best team for any given project.
        Originally, it was only envisioned to apply to university classroom
        situations.</span
      ><span class="v1157_17"
        ><br><br>Over time as we began to further visualize what this app would be, I
        recognized another problem that Flock Up could solve, one which all of
        us as college seniors face and that brings much stress and anxiety to
        our live. That being the seemingly ever growing need for preexisting
        experience needed for white-collar jobs or even internships. </span
      ><span class="v1157_18">Forming <br>The Vision</span
      ><span class="v1157_19"
        >Recent graduates in both the computer science and design/UX fields are
        facing the task of entering highly competitive industries. One of the
        biggest challenges is that many employers are looking for candidates
        that have already proven themselves, even for entry level
        positions.</span
      ><span class="v1157_20"
        >This creates a “chicken or the egg” situation where experience is
        needed to gain experience. Internships have traditionally offered a
        solution, however given the current economic environment, most
        internships require an existing portfolio just to get the chance to gain
        some experience. Consequently, many graduating students have not had the
        opportunity to build their portfolios that showcase their skills through
        participation in multiple and multi-disciplinary projects.</span
      ><span class="v1157_21"
        >As we developed the Flock Up concept, we realized that the tool could
        help solve the chicken or egg conundrum that was adding stress and
        anxiety to our lives, just as we are leaving the university cocoon and
        preparing to enter the real world of our chosen fields.</span
      ><span class="v1157_22">The Bigger Opportunity</span
      ><span class="v1157_23"
        >The Flock Up app project taught me a lot about working with complex
        requirements, cross- functional teams and most importantly, large scale
        design systems. Previously, I was used to focusing on a specific feature
        or single user flow, but in this case, I was forced to simultaneously
        visualize many different parts that make up the entire product, process
        and design. </span
      ><span class="v1157_24"
        >As the sole designer on the team, this became even more critically
        important as it became my role to manage the majority of the end-to-end
        process, including both design and development, as well as effectively
        managing the entire team in order to achieve our desired vision.</span
      ><span class="v1157_25"
        >I’ve been exposed to a wide set of issues that comes with large scale
        projects including scope creep. I’ve had to learn to communicate much
        better with non-designers, understand their abilities, limitations and
        unique perspectives.</span
      ><span class="v1157_26"
        >My biggest takeaway from the experience was that these are all things I
        enjoy on top of simply designing. Perhaps the is a design oriented
        project management role in my future.</span

        >There was no need to conduct an exhaustive search for the right
        participants to help us define the needs and wants of the target
        audience. We were the intended audience. This allowed us to base many of
        our decisions and choices on our own perspectives and goals. Never the
        less, to adhere to good research principles, I solicited and conducted a
        series of interviews with students outside our <br>group who were
        experiencing the <br>same challenges. </span
      ><span class="v1157_43"
        >These independent perspectives provided additional insights and guided
        me to <br>make more informed design choices. For example, I, as a user, only
        really cared if the project team could get its work done on time.
        Whereas other interviewees, valued team communication above all else.
        <br>The insight gained from balancing these perspectives led to the design
        and implementation of a group chat feature, modeled on Discord’s design,
        which most <br>of the people interviewed were familiar with and found easy
        to use, with virtually <br>no learning curve.</span
      ><span class="v1157_44"
        >The biggest factor leading to negative group project experiences was
        from having unmotivated or simply poor communicating group members drag
        down the rest of the team by not effectively contributing.</span
      ><span class="v1157_45"
        >The implementation of the teammate review feature allowed members to
        make more informed decisions about who to invite to join the team.</span
      ><span class="v1157_46"

        rather than all work together on one task at a time. </span
      ><span class="v1157_47"
        >Flock Up allowed users to sort by and equip specific skill tags that
        represented their strengths, simplifying the selection of a diverse set
        of abilities, while still allowing users to join with other similarly
        skilled individuals if they choose to.</span

        >Having reached a consensus about the vision and purpose of the Flock Up
        app, I laid out the two primary use cases which would each inform their
        own user journeys. The first use case was centered around finding people
        to join my team for a particular project. Whereas in the second use
        case, the user wanted to join someone else’s team and project. While
        both scenarios contained essentially the same functionality, they
        represent very different user perspectives and goals.</span

      <span class="v1157_323"
        >One of the victims of our timeline was our ability to conduct full user
        testing on the prototype. As a quicker alternative, I performed a
        heuristic analysis of the prototype, using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 general
        principles for interaction design as my guide post while developing the
        prototype. This solution allowed me to keep the development workstream
        on a user centered path even given the limited time and resources and to
        meet our deadline. Here are some examples of solutions that came out of
        the analysis –</span

          >The two main features of Flock Up, the group matchmaking and the
          group chat rooms were broken up into two separate navigations, both
          persistent regardless of which page the user is on. The chatroom
          system was specifically designed on a vertical access in order to feel
          familiar and recognizable to users who have used either Discord or
          Slack with each chat room represented with its own icon. This approach
          matched the system with the real world experience of the users.</span

        >When users are setting up their profiles, they are given the option to
        pick skill tags to add to their profiles. However to give the user a
        sense of freedom and control over the process, they have been given the
        ability to simply escape the set up process by hitting the “X” icon. At
        that point, they can jump straight into the site and set up their
        skills later.</span

          a pop up appears, pointing to where to look for a response. This
          provides the user with immediate feedback, confirming that their

      <span class="v1157_337">The Challenge</span
      ><span class="v1157_338"
        >By spending time to think through what the Flock Up app could be, who
        would be the target audience and what benefits would accrue from using
        the app, we were able to produce a well-defined idea that we believed
        could deliver real value. However, the unintended consequence of
        expanding the scope of the project meant it was becoming too much for
        us to be able to complete within our limited time. From a team dynamic
        perspective, neither the designers or the developers had a keen sense
        for how long each part of the project would take, from design to
        develop and deploy.</span
      ><span class="v1157_339"
        >This resulted in holding a group meeting to decide which features were
        truly essential to the vision, versus which ones were nice additions,
        but not essential. This exercise in scope management was difficult but
        taught us a lot about balancing scope and deadlines.</span
      ><span class="v1157_340"
        >For example, we were hoping to add a calendar system to help teams plan
        their project work. It would have definitely added to the value of the
        app, but it was not essential to key functionality and finding and
        selecting teams for the project. In the end, we placed a cap on the
        number of features we could add based on what was already planned
        out.</span
      ><span class="v1157_341"
        >Once we had defined the use cases and the envisioned what the user flow
        would be like in both scenarios, based on research and interviews, I
        was able to lay out wireframes to visualize all the pages and their
        requisite components needed to build the prototype. Here are a few of
