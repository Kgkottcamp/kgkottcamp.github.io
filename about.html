        >I am a designer in the User Experience sphere with a knack for
        transforming complex ideas into intuitive, user-friendly, digital
        experiences. <br><br> My interest in UX design was sparked during my
        freshman year at Washington State University, where I was enrolled in
        the Digital Technology and Culture program. However, I found myself
        yearning for a more traditional design education, which led me to
        transfer to Western Washington University. Over the past years here, I
        have continued to immerse myself in the world of design in an effort to
        hone my skills.<br><br> I have worked on numerous projects, each
        presenting new challenges that have pushed me to think critically,
        approach problems from different perspectives, and design solutions that
        put the user first. Beyond the classroom, I have engaged in contract
        work to apply my skills in the real-world. These experiences have
        furthered my understanding of the design process and solidified my
        commitment to this exciting and ever-evolving field.<br><br> Within the
        last six months, I have been obsessed with the explosion of AI
        technology. Whether it be creating art with StableDiffusion, researching
        and running opensource Large Language Model models similar to ChatGPT on
        my PC, or learning how to animate using ControlNet functionality, I
        immerse myself in this emerging field as they will inevitably become a
        standard part of the design workflow.<br><br> When I am not researching
        and prototyping, you can find me exploring the beautiful Pacific
        Northwest, backpack equipped with the necessities, ready to unwind and
        enjoy Mother Nature. If it's raining like it usually does in the PNW,
        then forget about all that: give me a PlayStation controller or a mouse
        and keyboard and I'll be set.<br><br> As I prepare myself for the next
        steps of my professional journey in UX design, I am eager to work on
        projects that contribute positively to the world, where I can apply my
        skills and contribute in a team setting. I believe that a great user
        experience can truly transform how people interact with technology – and
        I am excited to be a part of that transformation.<br><br> If you have a
        project in mind, want to discuss design, or just want to recommend a
        good hike or game to play let me know! I am always up for a
        conversation! <br><br></span
